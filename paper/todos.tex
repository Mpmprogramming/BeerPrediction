- extend wordlist for each aspect
- was machen wir jetzt eigtl mit w√∂rtern wie palate, taste etc. also unsere filter words? lassen wirs so?
- holdout dataset to account for risk of overfitting
- learn user rating behavior, acknowledge for individual differences in average score
- For each aspect we could separately model the words that discuss an aspect and words that discuss sentiment about an aspect.
